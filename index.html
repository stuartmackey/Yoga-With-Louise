				<p>Now offering Indian Head Massage therapy.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce that I am now able to offer Indian Head
Massage  treatments!  Indian Head Massage is a non-intrusive massage,
performed on the neck, head and face, using only the natural oils in
the skin - making it an ideal treatment for any time of the day, or
for those who don't like oil being used as in traditional massage.</p>

<p>Indian head massage helps increase joint mobility and flexibility in
the neck and shoulders, improves blood circulation and lymphatic flow,
frees knots of muscular tension, relaxes connective tissue, and aids
in the elimination of accumulated toxins and waste products. It is
particularly good for reducing the effects of stress and tension.</p>

<p>A variety of techniques are used, including deep kneading of muscles
in the neck, raking of the scalp and applying pressure to points on
the face, all of which promote and stimulate new skin cell growth and
healthy hair.</p>

<p>The treatment is given with the client fully clothed, seated in a
chair meaning it can be done anywhere, at any time.</p>

<p>Open to both yoga clients and non-yoga clients, treatments can last
between 20 and 45 mins, and a variety of appointment times are
available.</p>

<p>Please contact me by <span class="contactLink">email</span> or text for prices or any other information.</p>
